## Learnings üìö

I learned a lot during this project, it was an amazing experience! And I don't want to stop here. If possible, continue with improvements.

I feel like I'm even more confident in some knowledge, for example: useState, props, conditionals and API.

I loved working with ReactJS. And it's definitely the technology I want to keep learning and working on!

I tried to follow the proposed designer, with practicalities, best practices, and with some personal implementations.

A bit of trouble getting the full name for the second screen. Because at first I was using React Router. So I ended up switching to an on-screen conditional. Conditionals also used in the 'Add More' button feature.

#### Difficulties

- With the implementation of tests, it's something I'm looking to study more.
- With a little more time, I would improve the input with full name validation.

#### What would I do differently?

- Project creation: with Vite instead of create-react-app.
- In real work, commits would be more separate and frequent. It would be better to break the app build into even smaller parts.
- The styling would be with styled components (to learn more)

## Extra Features ‚≠ê

- Bonus: Add More Feature, using conditionals.
- Validation possible in the Bonus button of Add more: To accept numbers only. The code is commented out in the _TagItem.tsx_ file.
- Validation possible in the Add more bonus button: empty field. An error message appears.
- Validation possible in the Add More Bonus button: 20 character limit. An error message appears.
- Added some animations and hover's.
- Improved SEO in index.html. With favicon, page title and description.
- Git commit history, State management, Mandatory fields in forms, Validate user input in 1st screen (min: 6 characters).
- Seeking to implement Accessibility. With texts on images and titles on buttons.
- Responsiveness Adjustments.
- Added error screen: With message with empty api (delete all cards), with running the application without internet, or if there is a problem with the api link.
